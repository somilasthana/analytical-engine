# Analytical-Exploration
Developing Automated Response Engine

## Why do we need it
Imagine a Data Scientist trying to perform Exploration either using R or python or niche tools like Tableau, Power BI or Microstrategy. These are all tools and languages provide capacity to explore data and store in form of cubes and then what ? The scientist may pick one direction and move on to explore certain parts of data. A lot of exploration doesnt seems to get the importance it deserves and why would it be ? One can always go back and explore again. She can repeat this process multiple times but again she needs to pick up one direction. The idea of this tool is explore a huge data space - horizontially, vertically or tangentially and preserve this findings.

## Class Structure

## Introduction
The class structure looks way to complicated to comprehend. Instead set of examples and usage will make our task easy.
